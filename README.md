# scope-if-letStatements

A reminder for myself that any variable OUTSIDE of the scope of an if-let statement will NOT get printed out

In the excerise: 
//line 13 will NOT get printed. 
//Because the variable "giraffeSci" is NOT WITHIN the if-let statement, the whole if-let statement begins from line 7 and ends on line 11.
